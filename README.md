Modelling tool  

Abstract:
Cell cross-talk mechanism can be observed by learning the molecular pathways, You can integrate multiple pathways and learn the molecular interactions by observing pathway overlaps that could take place.

Introduction
Biology is moving from molecular to modular. As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that act as discrete functional systems.  These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion, proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems?   What are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise?  What types of experiments inform systems-level thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these systems?
This tool will introduce the Systems biologist scientists to contemporary Systems Biology focused on Networks, their constituents and their functional networks. The web based tool will develop multiple lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above as this would be a canvas and workbench for systems biologistics. Two major reasoning threads are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations.  I will demonstrate “how” cell- level functions arise and “why” mechanistic knowledge allows us to predict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.
